# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm from scratch in Python using Numpy.

## Introduction

PCA is a popular technique for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets. It works by identifying the most important features or variables in the data, and creating new variables that are linear combinations of the original variables. These new variables, called principal components, capture the maximum amount of information or variance in the data, while minimizing the amount of redundancy or correlation between the variables.

PCA is widely used in various fields such as image processing, signal processing, finance, and more. It is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, allowing us to explore the underlying structure and patterns in the data.

## Usage

The main code for performing PCA can be found in the notebook.
